# Bee Chat Web App
This app uses the [bee-chat-rest-api](https://github.com/skurnal2/ReactProjects/tree/master/bee-chat-rest-api) to get the items and uses it for an app made in react. 

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the BeeChat app. I also have included some really interesting animations in this application.
