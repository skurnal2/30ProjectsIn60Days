# Sunshine Meme Generator

## Idea

This application is based on a very popular meme-style image with a smiley and sunshine background in behind. I always wondered how this would look if we could rotate the background giving it a spotlight look. Also, making it dynamic gives us an opportunity to see how this meme can be developed even further.

## About Project

This application mainly runs on JavaScript powered by ReactJs Library. It uses the concept of States in React making the application very dynamic in nature. My main focus in this app was to tackle the usage of SVGs in websites. This is my first attempt in Designing and Dynamically changing the SVG content.

## How it works

With this application, we can upload an image (png with transparent background recommended) and it will dynamically place that image in the middle of the screen to act as a meme face. Then, the user can change the colors rotating in the background. Both colors are changable and dynamic including the SVG fill color as well as the CSS Background color on the DIV. Colors can be entered in two ways: <br>

- Using **Hex Values** (e.g. #f2f2f2)

- Using **Color Text** (e.g. Blue, Red)
